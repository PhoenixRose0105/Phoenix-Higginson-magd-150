  Assignment 4 requirements were to have:
  * Movement or an animation
  * Two (2) mouse and/or key pressed interactions
  * Two (2) _if_ statements
  * A _for_ or _while_ loop
  
The movement is achieved by a small violet dot following the mouse as it's moved over the canvas.

The second requirement is met with the _mouseIsPressed()_ function which changes the color of the diagonal line across the canvas from a light purple to a maroon color. The second portion is met by using _keyIsPressed()_ which reveals a maroon line vertically on the canvas.

Next, the two (2) _if_ statements are used with the _mouseIsPressed()_ and _keyIsPressed()_ code for the horizontal and vertical lines.

Finally, there are repeating dark purple slashes across the top which meets the _for_ loop requirement.
