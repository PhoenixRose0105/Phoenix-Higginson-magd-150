### Assignment 4
[Assignment 4.zip](https://github.com/PhoenixRose0105/Phoenix-magd-150/files/11345986/Assignment.4.zip)

  Assignment 4 requirements were to have:
  * Movement or an animation
  * Two mouse and/or key pressed interactions
  * Two _if_ statements
  * A _for_ or _while_ loop
  
The movement is achieved by a small violet dot following the mouse as it's moved over the canvas.

The second requirement is met with the _mouseIsPressed()_ function which changes the color of the diagonal line across the canvas from a light purple to a maroon color. The second portion is met by using _keyIsPressed()_ which reveals a maroon line vertically on the canvas.

Next, the two _if_ statements are used with the _mouseIsPressed()_ and _keyIsPressed()_ code for the horizontal and vertical lines.

Finally, there are repeating dark purple slashes across the top which meets the _for_ loop requirement.  



### Assignment 5

Assignment 5 requirements were to have:
* The weight of each area listed
* The composition within the theme of a tv or desktop computer
* Add a minimum of two buttons (a rectangle and an ellipse) that used the _mouseClicked()_ or _mousePressed()_ functions. It also required testing the position of the mouse compared to the boundary of the shapes with the _mouseX_ and _mouseY_ functions.
* Add another button that used the _keyPressed()_ function
* Include a minimum of two _if_ functions
* Incorporate principles of design  
  * A color scheme with a max of five colors
  * Alignment, proximity, similarity of elements in the composition
  * Scale and proportion

Unfortunately, I missed the first requirement.

To be within the theme, I created a tv on a flat surface.

The first two buttons are located on the bottom left of the tv. Both buttons will turn from red to green once it is clicked inside the boundary. The ellipse button utilizes the _mousePressed()_ function whereas the rectangle button uses the _mouseClicked()_ function.

In the upper right hand corner of the tv, there is a third button. It changes from a red to green color when any key is pressed, using the _keyIsPressed()_ function. The box on the tv screen also changes shades of gray when the left and right arrow keys are pressed, which uses the _keyPressed()_ function.

The three buttons and tv screen all utilize the _if_ function.

Finally, there is a total of four colors with a variation of two colors. There are two shades of brown, two shades of gray, red, and green.



### Assignment 6

Assignment 6 requirements were to:
* Have a theme of halloween, retro games, or nature
* Create and assign values to an array
* Use the _print_ function to determine the length of the created array
* Create an array and assign values to the array using a _for_ loop
* Create motion using values from an array by using a _for_ loop that included an array value as one of the positions for the shape
* Set a value in the array to the current mouse position value

The theme I chose was nature which met the first requirement. It shows a sun moving across a blue sky behind a flower sprouting from a pot.

I created an array which was used for the movement of the sun, the flower, and the pink circle that follows the mouse cursor. This meets requirements 2, 4, 5, and 6.

Finally, for the third requirement, I have the _print_ function set up to show the array lengths.



### Assignment 9

Assignment 9 requirements were to:
* Create or locate an audio file in the .wav, .aiff, or .mp3 format
* Load an audio file
* Play, pause, or loop the audio file
* Have an oscillator to create a 'sine' wave sound
* Create shapes, lines, or points to animate the 'sine' wave sound
* Access the webcam
* Apply a filter to the webcam video output

For the audio file, I included an .mp3 of a cat meow which could be played by pressing a key via the _keyIsPressed_ function. This also meets the second and third requirements.

For the fourth and fifth requirement, I included the oscillator and visual animations. As the mouse is moved over the canvas, the oscillator changes and the waves respond.

Finally, I included the use of the camera with the invert filter applied.
