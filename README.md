[Assignment 4.zip](https://github.com/PhoenixRose0105/Phoenix-magd-150/files/11345986/Assignment.4.zip)

  Assignment 4 requirements were to have:
  * Movement or an animation
  * Two mouse and/or key pressed interactions
  * Two _if_ statements
  * A _for_ or _while_ loop
  
The movement is achieved by a small violet dot following the mouse as it's moved over the canvas.

The second requirement is met with the _mouseIsPressed()_ function which changes the color of the diagonal line across the canvas from a light purple to a maroon color. The second portion is met by using _keyIsPressed()_ which reveals a maroon line vertically on the canvas.

Next, the two _if_ statements are used with the _mouseIsPressed()_ and _keyIsPressed()_ code for the horizontal and vertical lines.

Finally, there are repeating dark purple slashes across the top which meets the _for_ loop requirement.

Assignment 5 requirements were to have:
* The composition within the theme of a tv or desktop computer
* Add a minimum of two buttons (a rectangle and an ellipse) that used the _mouseClicked()_ or _mousePressed()_ functions. It also required testing the position of the mouse compared to the boundary of the shapes with the _mouseX_ and _mouseY_ functions.
* Add another button that used the _keyPressed()_ function
* Include a minimum of two _if_ functions
* Incorporate principles of design  
  * A color scheme with a max of five colors
  * Alignment, proximity, similarity of elements in the composition
  * Scale and proportion

To be within the theme, I created a tv on a flat surface.

The first two buttons are located on the bottom left of the tv. Both buttons will turn from red to green once it is clicked inside the boundary. The ellipse button utilizes the _mousePressed()_ function whereas the rectangle button uses the _mouseClicked()_ function.

In the upper right hand corner of the tv, there is a third button. It changes from a red to green color when any key is pressed, using the _keyIsPressed()_ function. The box on the tv screen also changes shades of gray when the left and right arrow keys are pressed, which uses the _keyPressed()_ function.

The three buttons and tv screen all utilize the _if_ function.

Finally, there is a total of four colors with a variation of two colors. There are two shades of brown, two shades of gray, red, and green.
